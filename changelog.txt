StitchIt Change-Log


06/01/2021:
- USER - MAJOR: fixes bug that was losing the upper half of the dynamic range in stitched images. 
- USER - stitchSection now handles an optional bidirectional phase correction. This is a fixed, user-provided,
     value that must be an integer. e.g. stitchSection([100,1],2,'bidishiftpixels',-1)

14/11/2020:
- USER (made in dev branch): Update auto-thresh alg for web preview
- USER (made in dev branch): Provide helpful messages in sampleSplitter if stitched planes or downsampled stacks are missing
- USER (made in dev branch): Fix a couple of bugs that could cause stitching to fail.


12/11/2020:
- USER/DEVELOPER: sample splitter reports autoROI performance to stitchit log file [prerelease]


5/11/2020:
- Bugfix - Sample spliter was not reading the pixel size from the downsampled file names.


25/09/2020:
- Bugfix - since May 12th the sample splitter was not renaming acquisitions. Only directories. This is now fixed. 


24/06/2020:
- User/DEVELOPER [branch dev]: downsampleAllChannels loads data only once for each resolution level.


09/06/2020:
- User/DEVELOPER [branch dev]: Remove TissueCyte settings from INI file. The TissueCyte settings are now gone from the StitchIt ini files. You should remove the [experiment], [micsPerPixel], and "Objectives" sections. See the stitchitConf_DEFAULT.ini file for an example. 


13/03/2020
- DEVELOPER MAJOR: Dev branch. Drop TissueCyte support. StitchIt handles only BakingTray data now. There is a release associated with this commit. Refactor BakingTray stitching files and remove possibility of adding other stitching system systems. The flexibility isn't being used and it's worth the confusion. 
- USER MAJOR: Stitching using stage positions now works.

11/06/2020
- USER: downsampled stacks now have illumination changes across depths corrected to a large degree


20/03/2020
- USER: Downsampled stacks now contain the channel name (as a string -- "red" or "green") in the file name.
- USER: stitchedPlanesToVolume produces stacks that contain the channel name the file name.

21/02/20
- MAJOR USER: New folder structure for downsampled stacks. *MAY BREAK BEHAVIOR OF DOWNSTREAM CODE*


23/01/2020
- USER: Sample splitter tidies away meta-data in sample root directory when finished. 


07/10/19
- USER: Add "chessboardStitch.m" and "exploreChessboard.m" for assisting with stitching parameter tweaking.


03/10/2019
- USER: syncAndCrunch now *requires* the name of the acquisition system as an input argument 
        so we can handle multiple microscopes at once from one analysis PC.


26/09/2019
- USER: Slightly improve appearance of montage images in web preview. 


05/06/2019
- USER: downsampleAllChannels makes TIFF files by default since
Elastix is now happy with these.


28/04/2019
- USER: The auto-threshold algorithm is tweaked to deal with small brain areas. 
    **Involves a small change in the threshold parameter** You will need to use
    larger values and the cut-off before absolyte thresholding is now 25 not 10. 


20/03/2019
- USER: Main web preview image is RGB.
- USER: New adaptive option for setting web preview threshold (see default INI file) 
SUGGESTED ACTION: users modify their INI file such the rescale thresh=4 and the new comment text is 
                added in from the default INI file. 
- USER: stitchit.sampleSplitter ready for beta use by users


15/03/2019
- USER: Add GUI (stitchit.sampleSplitter) for breaking up acquisitions with two brains into two separate 
        folders. Also allows cropping of a 
 single brain. GUI not heavily tested yet but it works.


02/01/2019
- Tidy files to make discovery of StitchIt features easier for users.
- DEVELOPER: New function "findStitchedData" to aid more flexible handling of already stitched data. 


04/01/2019
- MAJOR: syncAndCrunch runs the web preview as a background task so it keeps up better with high bandwidth acquisitions.
         You can now change which channel is being sent to the web by editing the file at /tmp/buildSectionRunnerTargetChannel so you you could do: echo "3" > /tmp/buildSectionRunnerTargetChannel
- mhd_write and the YAML reader are integrated into the repo, making instalation easier.


04/08/2018
- Bugfix: was failing to read z voxel size correctly.
- Now reads the most recent BakingTray recipe file, even if there are multiple.


13/07/2018
- MAJOR: syncAndCrunch has new call system! See "help syncAndCrunch" and note you need to edit your INI file. See the default INI file and https://github.com/BaselLaserMouse/StitchIt/wiki/Setting-up-syncAndCrunch


18/06/2018
- MAJOR - BakingTray tiles can be manipulated (undistorted and affine transformed) to allow for better stitching. User must edit StitchingParameters.VoxelSize in recipe to tweak mics per pixel if needed.
- MAJOR - Bugfix in BakingTray tile loader means the tileRotate parameter in the INI file will likely 
need changing. 


2018/05/02
- MAJOR: Allow for optional tile rotation during image loading. Note the new tileRotate argument to the INI file under the "tile" section. 
- Average image tile collation is now only performed during syncAndCrunch for the first few sections and then again at the end. 

2017/12/10 
- preProcessTiles now takes paramater/value pairs as input arguments
- Image offset is read from ScanImage file header and is not calculated. 


2017/10/16
- MAJOR: stitching-related parameters (including average images) are now stored in a separate location 
         to the raw data. So data sets processed prior to this date will need preprocessing again. 
         Suggest you first delete existing average images, as they take up a lot of space. 
- Bugfix to cope with a situation where the user starts acquiring data from an extra channel mid-way
  through the acquisition. 

2017/10/10
- MAJOR: coefficients needed to stitch images (with the exception of the tileIndex) are now kept 
         in rawData/stitchitPreProcessingFiles/. You will need to update your INI file by copying
         the relevant bit from the default INI file.


2017/10/06
- MAJOR: Offset subtraction is now set via the INI file. You will see warnings on screen until you add 
         this setting to your INI file.
- Improvements in the way the offset correction is performed.
- Remove calcAverageBinFiles since we now only calculate the newer .mat files


2017/09/21
- MAJOR: Enable offset correction in bakingtray.tileLoad. This seems necessary for Femto amps as they drift. 


2017/09/21
- Bugfix to illumination corrector: error was generated if average file could not be found. 


2017/07/13
- Average tiles saved as a structure.
- syncAndCrunch works with BakingTray where sections are saved directly to a "rawData" directory.
- Remove "averageSlowRows" option from INI file. 
- Ability to stitch and average rectangular frames from BakingTray. 


2017/05/11
 - Improve docs and bug fix in stitchAllChannels.

2017/05/04: 
 - MAJOR: take away the option to remove channel 3 in syncAndCrunch
 - BakingTray: moved to ScanImage multi-channels TIFFs. No longer reads split channels.
 - Fix regression that was causing average image correction to fail with BT data
 - Peeksection now stitches the first available channel by default. Not channel 2. 
 - DEVELOPER NOTE: meta-data format is now documented (help readMetaData2Stitchit)
 - DEVELOPER NOTE: image processing moved out of tileLoad functions

2017/05/02
- Add makeCompositeOfPlane.m, which creates composite RGB images for use in Fiji with Bioformats

2017/03/12
- MAJOR: stitchAllSubDirectories is now stitchAllChannels. please see "help stitchAllChannels"
- MAJOR: The syncAndCrunch has new default values for the inputs:
    * "combCorChans" argument now defaults to 1.
    * "illumChans" argument now automatically selects all available channels.
    * "chanToPlot" argument now automatically selects the first channel in illumChans.
- buildSectionPreview by default chooses the first available channel if none are provided.
- stitchSection will not proceed if the requested operation will fill the disk.
- syncAndCrunch does not proceed if local and server dirs are the same.
- Disk space reporter now works on Windows as well as Mac/Linux.
- Delete web directory (forWWW) at completion of syncAndCrunch.
- DEVELOPER NOTE: Minor bugfixes, cleanup (isfield calls relating to the INI file), mass tabs to spaces conversion.

2017/03/09
- MAJOR: identifyMissingTilesInDir now optionally replaces missing tiles with adjacent ones in the same x/y positition instead of blank tiles. (Merged commit from Natalia Chicherova, Fouga fork).
- Renamed postAcqfFun to  postAcqFun in the INI file. (BREAKS EXISTING INI FILES)

2017/03/03
- saveMatrixAsCSV now runs on Windows.
- DEVELOPER NOTE: Read BakingTray v0.5 recipe files.

2017/02/28
- mergeChannels incorporates in place the addition, subtraction, etc, functions from Yunyun Han.

2017/02/21
- Seamless stitching bugfix so it works on more recent MATLAB versions. 

2017/01/29
- syncAndCrunch checks if the user's repo is up to date (Unix only)

2017/10/19
- Fix bug that was causing stitching not to begin when acquisition ended.
- DEVELOPER NOTE: some syncAndCrunch errors are now being saved to a file called StitchIt_Log.txt in the sample directory. Aids debugging.

2016/11/22
- Go back to stitching *sections* in parallel instead of loading tiles in parallel. This is much faster. 

2016/11/01
- DEVELOPER NOTE: BakingTray largely working. (beta feature)

2016/05/01
- Move repo to GitHub
