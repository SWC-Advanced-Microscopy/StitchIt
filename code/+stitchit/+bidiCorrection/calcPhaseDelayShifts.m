function stats=calcPhaseDelayShifts(im,nBands,verbose)

% Divide image into nBands vertical strips and calculate the phase delay in each
%
% function stats=calcPhaseDelayShifts(im,nBands,verbose)
%
%
% PURPOSE
% Bidirectional scanning introduces a phase delay between the outgoing an returning
% scan paths of the x mirror. Every other scan line is in-sync but adjacent lines
% are out of sync. This can be corrected at acquisition time by manually setting a
% phase delay parameter. This doesn't always produce perfect results, however.
% Potential reasons for this include:
% a) phase different between adjacent scan lines differs with distance from the turn-around
%    points due to acceleration and deceleration of the scanner.
% b) possible drift in the ideal correction value
% c) acquisition software re-assigns pixels in random ways by trying (and failing) to correct
%    for bidirectional scanning errors on-line.
%
% For the above reasons, it's worth trying an off-line correction.
%
% This function divides up the image into a set of vertical bands and calculates the phase
% delay between adjacent scan lines separately for each. We do this because the delay is
% is different toward the edges than in the middle of the image. This function simply
% calculates coefficients, which can be saved and re-used to save time. The function
% "applyPhaseDelayShifts" uses the coefficients structure returned by this function to
% correct an image.
%
%
% INPUTS
% im - a single monochromatic image or image stack.
% nBands - how many bands to divide the image into. An odd number of suggested. A
%          reasonable value would be 9, which is the default value. If empty, default
%          value is used.
% verbose - the verbosity level. 0 means no output. 1 reports shifts to screen.
%
%
% OUTPUTS
% stats - a structure containing the shifts, band locations, corrected row
%         identities, etc. Feed this to applyPhaseDelayShifts to apply a correction to
%         an image.
%
%
%
% ALGORITHM
% 1) Divide image in "nBands" non-overlapping vertical strips.
% 2) For each strip pull out odd and even scan lines and treat these as two separate
%    images, say "image_A" and "image_B".
% 3) Treat image_A as the "fixed" image and register image_B to it using cross-correlation,
%    which we do in the Fourier domain for speed (code adapted from FEX #1840 by Manuel Guizar).
% 4) Extract whole-pixel shifts for each band.
% 5) Knowing the band positions, pixel shift value, and which image rows constitute "image_A" and
%    "image_B", we can shift into register the alternate scan lines using applyPhaseDelayShifts
%
% KNOWN ISSUES
% 1) We are using whole pixel shifts only because this is slightly faster and because applying
%    sub-pixel shifts can create subtle image artifacts, particularly for noisy images.
% 2) If the phase difference between image_A and image_B is fairly large (with "large" being)
%    application-dependent) then features in the image may appear noticeably translated following
%    correction. This might be an issue if we are applying this correction to, say, different
%    different optical sections of an image stack, where the same features should be at least
%    partially visible across slices. Shifting *both* sets of scan lines around an average value
%    should take care of this when the required correction is >1 pixel.
