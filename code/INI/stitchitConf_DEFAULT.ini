;; sub-directories
;; When StitchIt runs it looks for certain data in particular places and creates
;; certain directories as it runs. The names of these directories are defined
;; here. There should be no reason to ever change these values. It is not 
;; recommended that you change the settings in subdir.
;; Note that in all cases, to avoid creating a sub-directory simply set the directory
;; name to "."

;; Our TissueVision system does not correctly report the number of microns per 
;; pixel in the Mosaic file. We therefore measured this and the following few
;; sections are responsible for correctly telling StitchIt what this value is.
;; We define the number of microns per pixel with respect to a particular image
;; size. It might have been better to define it using scan angle, but right now
;; we do it with respect to an image size of 1664 x 1664. 
;; Note that [experiment], [micsPerPixel], and the objective sections are only
;; for the TissueVision. We assume that other systems will correctly report the
;; number of microns per pixel in the image meta-data. 

;;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[experiment]
;; Set this to be the objective used in your experiment. This value is 
;; used to determine where to place the tiles. Its name must correspond to one of the
;; the objective name sections below. The _x_x that suffixes some names refers to the 
;; scan angle. e.g. _2_2 is a scan angle of 2.2
objectiveName=Nikon16x_2_2
;;objectiveName=Nikon16x_3_0
;;objectiveName=Zeiss20x



;;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;This section determines how StitchIt will calculate the number of microns
;;per pixel. This is important because StitchIt uses this number to position
;;the tiles. It needs to know the number of microns per pixel both for 
;;naive positioning and stage coordinate positioning.  
;;


[micsPerPixel]
;;We calculate the number of microns per pixel by imaging an EM grid. The number of 
;;microns per pixel must be in reference to a particular image size. This is defined
;;here. e.g. 1664 by 1664 pixels
numPix=1664

;;The following setting allows us to choose whether we want to use a single number
;;for both X and Y or different numbers. Using a single number (usemeasured=1)
;;causes us to use "micsPerPixel" and setting usemeasured to 0 casuses us to use
;;the two separate row and col values. The need to tweak the number may arise from 
;;the sampling accuracy of the measurements which creates rounding errors in the FFT. 
;;1 means use the measured, single, value for both x and y. 0 means use the other
;;two values (micsPerPixelRows and micsPerPixelCols.
usemeasured=0

[Zeiss20x]
;;In case the user tweaks this value, we log here in the comments that the
;;default value for the 20x at 1664^2 is 0.485 microns/pixel 
micsPerPixelMeasured=0.485

;;The following two numbers are based on the above but tweaked. The 
;;tweaking was done by trying out a bunch of different conversion factors
;;and seeing what worked best. They allow for setting different numbers
;;of microns per pixel in x and y. This may not be necessary and may be
;;removed in future. 
micsPerPixelRows=0.468
micsPerPixelCols=0.450
